To track the student's activity and progress, the code could potentially use some sort of persistent storage, such as a database or local storage, to store information about which lessons and activities the student has completed. The completed property of each lesson and activity object could be updated accordingly, and the UI could be updated to reflect the student's progress.

Implemented progress bar for every lesson statically.

Still the code can be customized.
